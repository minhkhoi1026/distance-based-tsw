Official implementation of the paper "Distance-Based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance" (ICLR 2025).


## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of Distance-Based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance (DB-TSWD), a novel approach for computing optimal transport distances between probability distributions. Our method extends the traditional Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance by incorporating distance-based tree construction, leading to more accurate and efficient transport computations.
